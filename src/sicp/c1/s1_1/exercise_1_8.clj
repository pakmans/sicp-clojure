;; Exercise 1.8.
;;Â Newton's method for cube roots is based on the fact that if y is an 
;; approximation to the cube root of x, then a better approximation is given 
;; by the value (/ (+ (/ x (sqr y)) (* 2 y)) 3)
;; Use this formula to implement a cube-root procedure analogous to the 
;; square-root procedure.

  (/ (+ (/ x (square guess)) (* 2 guess)) 3))
